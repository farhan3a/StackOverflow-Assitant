# StackOverflow-Assitant
An interactive conversational chatbot that assists with a search on StackOverflow and holds a dialogue using a dialogue manager

# Final project: StackOverflow assistant bot

Congratulations on coming this far and solving the programming assignments! In this final project, we will combine everything we have learned about Natural Language Processing to construct a *dialogue chat bot*, which will be able to:
* answer programming-related questions (using StackOverflow dataset);
* chit-chat and simulate dialogue on all non programming-related questions.

For a chit-chat mode we will use a pre-trained neural network engine available from [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot).
Those who aim at honor certificates for our course or are just curious, will train their own models for chit-chat.
